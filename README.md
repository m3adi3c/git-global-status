# Getting git status for all repos
This repo will contain scripts for getting `git status` for all the repositories on your machine, assuming they all reside in the same directory.

I know there are [lots](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18757843/git-status-over-all-repos#18760535) of options for this, made by much more skilled people than myself. But I couldn't miss the oportunity to learn some more programming for this purpose.

I will write first a Python script, but hopefully I will be able to come up with Bash and more alternatives. Just for fun.

**Remark:** The main intention is educational (for myself first) and most probably it will *not* get fancy or "pro", in any sense that may have. So keep that in mind whenever you find issues or annoyances with it.
